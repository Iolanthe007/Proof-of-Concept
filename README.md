# Proof-of-Concept

Background

The idea for The Hieroglyphics Initiative developed during the production of the 2017 Ubisoft video game Assassinâ€™s Creed: Origins, set in Ptolemaic Egypt. The consulting Egyptologist for the game, Perrine Poiron, helped make the gamer experience as authentic as possible. Although development of The Hieroglyphics Initiative slowed between 2017 and 2019, the company spearheading the project, Psycle (in association with Ubisoft), and multi-billion dollar company Google have since collaborated to move the project forward. 
By harnessing the ability of computers to learn, interpret, and process, The Hieroglyphics Initiative aims to  produce a tool that can improve the process of translating hieroglyphic texts. It has the potential to assist researchers in Egyptology in producing translations, but it also has the potential to become a useful pedagogical tool. By streamlining the process of capturing and processing images, as well as being able to produce facsimiles and line drawings, The Hieroglyphics Initiative can potentially combine both epigraphy and translation into one self-contained process.
